libdraw3 - lightweight graphics for you

A number of observations inspired writing this library
	- memory has grown large compared to frame buffer size
	- cpus are more than fast enough for small time software 3d
	- every device with a display has a graphics accelerator for big time 3d
	- there are no simple cross platform graphics libraries

Libdraw3 supports two kinds of objects
	- images, and
	- triangles
		- which can be rendered to images
		- with images as textures
		- the usual perspective corrected interpolation jazz

Libdraw3 only supports buffered operation
	- ask for an image
	- draw to it
	- give it to display

Libdraw3 supports window resizing
	- the new image you get happens to be of a different size
	
Libdraw3 is designed around the observation that what graphics acceleration does well is triangles
	- a function is called per vertex (a vertex shader)
	- a function is called per pixel (a pixel shader)
	- values passed per vertex are hyperbolically interpolated in the pixel realm
	- the pixel realm can access textures based on any of its interpolated values
